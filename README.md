Check out my website ðŸ‘‰ [CLICK HERE](https://hafid-davila.github.io/My-Modern-Website/)

Is a project that fallows up on my most privious project my [Old School HTML website](https://github.com/Hafid-Davila/Old_School_HTML_website) project. 
In both of this projects I am using the skills that I have acquired by putting in practice what I have learned in [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://github.com/angelabauer/web-development-bootcamp) by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://twitter.com/yu_angela). 
<br>

Like I said before both of this projects are a work in progress and I don't know what is next. I will continue to update this part of the repository, at least once a week, with all my progress.

 So far I have worked with:
 - HTML DIVs
 - The Box Model of Website CSS Styling 
 <br>

 This project has taken longer than expected. I got sick with COVID-19 and was out of my coding game for 2 weeks!
 <br>
 Now I am back better than ever, baby! 
 <br>
 
 I have worked on different CSS aspects of my website such as:
 - CSS display properties
 - CSS static and relative positioning 
 - CSS absolute positioning 
 - CSS font styling and sizing
