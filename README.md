Is a project that fallows up on my most privious project my [Old School HTML website](https://github.com/Hafid-Davila/Old_School_HTML_website) project. 
In both of this projects I am using the skills that I have acquired by putting in practice what I have learned in [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://github.com/angelabauer/web-development-bootcamp) by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://twitter.com/yu_angela). 
<br>

Like I said before both of this projects are a work in progress and I don't know what is next. I will continue to update this part of the repository, at least once a week, with all my progress.

 *(Update: 11/08/2022)* 
 So far I have worked with:
 - HTML DIVs
 - The Box Model of Website CSS Styling
